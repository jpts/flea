Files that need to be changed:

flea.h: includes paths that may need to be customised for your system.
Specifically the #define TECHFILES needs to contain the full path to
the directory under which the included lib directory will be installed.


Environment variable PLOUTPUT is the program executed to plot to the
HP plotter, the default is "lpr -Ppl"
(The device name for flea is PL)

Environment variable LWOUTPUT is the program executed to plot to the
laser printer, the default is "lpr -Plw"
(The device name for flea is LW) 

You need to set up the lib directory included in the place specified 
in flea.h,  If you are not using the mosis CIF layer names, or the
berkley scmos techfile, then you may need to change some of the files
in this directory.  The man pages describes the format of those files.

You may also need to update or change the file 'flearc' in the lib
directory.
